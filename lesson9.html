            <h2>Iteration</h2>
            <p>The initial motor controller was an Arduino connected to a breadboard circuit of 2 buttons for clockwise and counter clockwise spin as well as a potentiometer speed controller. But the jumper wires are really loose and short, the potentiometer was very sensitive and didn't allow mid spin speed change, and the overall setup was hard to access and use.</p>

            <p class="media-caption">The actual circuitry</p>
            <p>While exploring for a more refined way of controlling the motor, I've found the ZK SMC02, which has more secure wiring and much easier program the movement and speed.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The motor controller was then wired up and functioning. But a mount needed to be made for neatness and usability. So a mount was 3D printed to fit retroactively onto the machine.</p>

            <p>The motor controller was mounted onto the machine and multiple algorithms were programmed for the rotary table. Unfortunately, videos of the machine are unavailable due to a signed NDA.</p>
